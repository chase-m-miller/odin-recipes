    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Focaccia is a rich and delicious bread made with olive oil. 
        If you eat too much of it you will die. But you will never know 
        how much is too much until you eat that much. Live dangerously.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g bread flour</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>4g yeast</li>
        <li>400g room temperature water</li>
        <li>68g extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Add water and stir until no dry flour remains, 
            about 2 minutes. Add 20 grams olive oil and stir to incorporate, using hands if necessary. 
            Cover with plastic wrap, then let wrest at room temperature for an hour.
        </li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap (but don't discard), and, using a lightly greased bowl scraper, fold 
            dough over itself by lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 45 degrees 
            and fold dough again; repeat turning and folding motion 4 more times (total of 6 folds). 
            Cover tightly with reserved plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this entire folding process once more. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and 
            refrigerate for at least 18 hours or up to 3 days.
        </li>
        <li><em>Baking the Focaccia:</em> Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 
            10 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour, then transfer it to a 
            lightly-floured work surface. Shape it by holding it with well-floured hands and tucking 
            the dough underneath itself, rotating it until it forms a tight ball.
        </li>
        <li>Pour 27 grams (1 ounce; 2 tablespoons) olive oil into 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet and 
            spread over entire inner surface (including rim) with your hands. Transfer dough to pan, 
            turn to coat in oil, position seam-side-down, and spread gently with your hands to mostly 
            fill the pan (don't worry if dough doesn't fully stretch to edges). Cover tightly with 
            plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough is very soft and puffy and nearly 
            doubled in volume, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position. Place baking stone or 
            Baking Steel on it, and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Using your fingertips, gently press 
            and stretch dough to evenly fill all corners of the pan. Lift up one edge of the dough to 
            let air bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around the dough until there are no 
            large air bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread around the pan. Using 
            fingertips, gently press on surface of dough to create small dimples. Drizzle remaining 
            20 grams (0.7 ounces; 1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil over top of dough, then sprinkle with 
            coarse sea salt.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer skillet to oven, positioning it on top of baking stone, and bake, rotating pan 
            halfway through baking, until top is golden brown and bottom is golden brown and crisp 
            when you lift it with a thin spatula, 25 to 30 minutes. Let focaccia cool in skillet for 
            5 minutes, then use a thin spatula to transfer focaccia to wire rack set inside a rimmed 
            baking sheet. Spoon or brush any olive oil left in the skillet over the focaccia, and let 
            cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature.
